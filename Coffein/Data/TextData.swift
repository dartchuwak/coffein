let cappuccinoPreviewText = "Cappuccino is one of Italy’s most beloved exports, and enjoys popularity worldwide. It was sidelined for a while, but has made a comeback in recent years. It’s a great example of one of the many types of espresso drinks that people love to drink."

let lattePreviewText = "It’s one of the most popular types of coffee drinks around, thanks to its mild, milky flavor profile. It’s perfect for those who are flirting with coffee for the first time. The cafe latte originated in the United States, but its inspiration is the latte macchiato, an Italian classic. A small amount of espresso is drizzled over steamed milk in a tall glass, hence the name, “latte macchiato” which translates to “stained milk.”"

let americanoPreviewText = "According to historians, American soldiers stationed in Italy during World War II just couldn’t handle the strong espresso they were served in local cafes. Their solution was to add hot water in order to create a drink that was more like the coffee they enjoyed in their home country. Whether or not this story is true, a cafe americano is a rich and deeply satisfying beverage. In Italy, an Americano is called a lungo, and is created by pulling an extra-long shot of espresso."

let espressoPreviewText = "A ristretto or “restricted” shot of espresso should have a volume of around 0.84 ounces (25 milliliters), and the extraction time should take around 25 seconds. With these specifications, the result will be a perfectly balanced and complex espresso with no hint of bitterness. A doppio espresso is the way to go if you want more volume. It’s fairly straightforward: double the amount of ground coffee used in the portafilter. Then, lengthen the extraction time and you’ll end up with more espresso to savor. "

let flatWhitePreviewText = "These days, it’s a firm favorite in trendy cafes from London to New York and everywhere in between. What is a flat white coffee, exactly? A wet cappuccino? A small cafe latte? A closeup of a barista creating Latte art. Flat white advocates will tell you it’s all about the texture of the milk. The microfoam has to be “just so” to qualify the resulting blend of espresso and steamed milk for true flat white status."

let glacePreviewText = "Café glace is a refreshing coffee beverage that combines a number of elements to produce a frothy and delicious drink. This iced coffee selection is ideal for an afternoon pick me up or as a beverage to be enjoyed after the evening meal. Many coffee shops offer some type of coffee drink that can be properly called a Café glace, but it is also possible to create the beverage at home."

let irishPreviewText = "Irish coffee is a hot and potent cocktail invented by Irish chef Joe Sheridan in the 1940s. It consists of black coffee, Irish whiskey, brown sugar, and cream - which should not be whipped, according to the original recipe. Although it originates from Ireland, the drink became popular throughout the world, especially in the USA, where it was brought by a writer named Stanton Delaplane."

let latteMacchiatoPreviewText = "Latte macchiato is a glass of milk \"stained\" by pouring espresso on it. It uses the same ingredients as a caffè latte, but its preparation and serving are different. An excellent latte macchiato comes in a tall glass where you can see the layers of milk below the glass, espresso in the middle, and foam on top."

let macchiatoPreviewText = "Espresso macchiato is another coffee drink that originated in Italy, where it’s called cafe macchiato. This elegant little beverage consists of a single or double ristretto shot of espresso, “stained” with a small amount of fine milk foam. The milk enhances the complex espresso without diluting it too much, resulting in a rich and delicious drink."

let mochaPreviewText = "Coffee and chocolate share many similarities, and can often be found growing on the same plantation. They tend to display many of the same tasting notes, so it’s no surprise that they go great together. A cafe mocha is essentially a cafe latte with the addition of chocolate.The best cafe mochas contain specialty chocolate sauce that’s blended with hot espresso."

let rafPreviewText = "Close your eyes and imagine drinking hot vanilla ice-cream just with coffee? Smooth, sweet and silky with nice and creamy aftertaste – this is all about Raf coffee. What is Raf? You may ask, and it comes as no surprise. Being one of the most popular and common drink of the Russian coffee scene for the last 20 years, Raf is still almost unknown outside the borders."

let viensePreviewText = "There are a few variations on the Vienna, but one of the most common is made with two ingredients: espresso and whipped cream. The whipped cream takes the place of milk and sugar to provide a creamy texture."

let cappuccinoDetailsText = "STEP 1\nPrepare the espresso.\nSTEP 2\nPour milk to the pitcher.\nSTEP 3\nMake sure your steam wand cloth is moist. Purge the steam wand and pull it to far up and straight position. Place the pitcher so that the nozzle is aligned to the steam wand. Make sure the steam wand nozzle is in the middle of the pitcher and just below the milk surface. Tilt the pitcher a bit to optimize the whilrpool later on.\nSTEP 4\nSwitch on the steam wand. Create froth for the first couple of second (up until the milk has reached 37 c). While froth is created, the volume of the milk increases so be sure to have the steam wand nozzle close to the milk surface all the way through. The longer you keep the nozzle close to milk surface the more froth you will create.\nWhen you have reached 37 c, rise the pitcher a bit so that the nozzle gets deeper into milk. Make sure the nozzle does not touch the bottom of the pitcher!\nFind a perrfect position where the whilrpool of milk is created. Keep warming the milk until it reaches +55-62 c.\nSTEP 5\nSwirl the milk in the pitcher until it is smooth, silky and shiny.\nSTEP 6\nPour the cappuccino and enjoy! "
